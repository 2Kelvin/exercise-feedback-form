In this project:

- I use `state` to keep track of the feedback message from the user through the `input value` of the textarea
- the test was on where to initiate hooks. Which should definitely be at the top level of a file or a component. Not in a conditional statement or loop
- I learnt that all hook calls should happen before the first return statement in the component
